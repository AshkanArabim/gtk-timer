# gtk-timer

A small timer app I made to practice my GTK + Vala skills.

## Demo
You can find a short demonstration on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgmOB3_oHsk

## To-Do
There are things I still want to do, which I'll handle when I need to learn GSettings and Gnome's notification system. 
- [ ] Save user's timers + other data in GSettings
- [ ] Send a notification when a timer is done (instad of just resetting it)
- [ ] Instead of an fullscreen button, make it such that clicking anywhere on the timer opens the fullscreen view.
